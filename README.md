## Project Description/Outline
Take 5 cities and identify which offer the best business opportunities for 
housing(Real Estate), apparel and services, Entertainment. We will do so,
by analyzing consumer spending, CPI(cost of goods), and employee compensation
increases. Three years of data from 2018-2021 will be analyzed.

## Research Questions to Answer 
- What cities offer the best profit opportunity for each industry?
- What are the trends for all threee industries?
- I don't want to run a business, what are the best stocks for each
 of these industries from 2018-2021?
