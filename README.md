# Project Title: **Bang for your Buck: Analyses of Consumer Price Index (CPI) select measures and the stock market (2015-2021)**
 
## Team Members
Ayana Martinez, Nathan Vasquez, Mo Wahome

## Project Description/Outline
We will examine 3 cities (Seattle, Philadelphia, and Los Angeles), their CPI measures (housing, apparel, and food away from home) and compare their year over year percent change to the annual percent change for the relevant stock market tickers. We will use CPI data from 2012-2021 and stock data from 2015 to current. Seven years of data from 2018-2021 will be used in final analyses. 

## Research Questions to Answer 
- For each industry, during the biggest increase and decrease in CPI percent change, what was the stock market percentage change during the same year?
- Which city has the highest rate of inflation for each industry?
- What the trends with trade counts during periods of high inflation in each industry?

## Datasets to be used
1. These are for 1 city(Philadelphia), we have the same pages for other 2 cities. We'll use annual CPI column for housing, apparel, and food away from home variables and import the tables.
[CPI Data Philly](https://www.bls.gov/regions/mid-atlantic/news-release/consumerpriceindex_philadelphia.htm)

2. ALPACA APIs for stock data for select real estate stocks, commercial food stocks, and apparel stocks.

## Rough Breakdown of Tasks
- (create konbon on git to assign tasks)
- Convert data from csv files to dataframes for analyses
- Create all necessary notebooks and files for the project repository
- Bring in any relevant stock data from API(alpacas)
- Clean the data 
- Calulcate percent changes for CPI and stocks
- Analyze data
- Create visualizations (at least 6)
- Throw in something nifty(1 uncovered library)
- Interpret findings
- Summarize findings in README.md
- Presentation practice

## Findings
* Stocks are good to hedge against inflation but dependent on industry.
- Housing CPI and Food away from home CPI have generally increased over time while Apparel CPI is cyclical.
- For all 3 cities, the relationship between CPI and stock data in the Food and Housing Industries showed similar results. 
- There was no clear relationship between CPI and stock data in the Apparel Industry regardless of city.
- Philadelphia and Seattle had somewhat inconsistent at times as far as high inflation and trade count. However, LA (second largest US market) seemed to have a direct influence on national trade count during periods of high inflation in LA housing and food.
